Viewing Sensor Data During Acquisition
======================================

This example shows how to view the sensor data during acquisition. This is useful for
monitoring the data during acquisition.

This example will:

1. Connect to the DE server
2. Start an acquisition
3. Continuously update a plot of the sensor data during acquisition
4. Continually update a plot of the virtual image 0 (The sum of the sensor data) during acquisition

    client.connect(port=13241)  # connect to the running DE Server

    client.scan(size_x=128, size_y=128, enable="On")

Plotting the Sensor Data
------------------------
We will plot the sensor data during acquisition. Note that matplotlib will block unless you are
using the Qt backend, and you won't get a live view unless you initialize the plot first and then
update the data. If you have troubles with this please raise an issue on the github page.
