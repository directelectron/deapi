DE API
======

This is the API for DE Server. It is a Python package that provides a set of
functions to interact with the DE Server.  It will not work without an installation
of DE Server, although the package can be installed without it.

Examples of usage can be found in the `Examples` directory which give an idea of
the functionality of the package and can be used as a starting point.


Installation
------------
The package can be installed using pip, or with conda from the conda-forge channel.
We recommend using conda as the protobuf package sometimes will install the most
recent versions which is not always compatible with older python versions.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install deapi

or

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge deapi
